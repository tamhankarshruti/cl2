1. Definition

A User Persona is a fictional representation of an ideal or target user of a product, system, or service.
It is based on user research, data, and behavior patterns collected from real users.
Personas help designers, developers, and product managers understand the users’ needs, goals, challenges, and motivations, enabling user-centered design.

2. Purpose of User Persona

Creating user personas helps to:

Understand who the users are and what they need.

Focus on user-centered decision-making throughout product development.

Align the design and functionality of the system with user expectations.

Communicate user needs clearly to the entire project team.
